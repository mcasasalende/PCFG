# PCFG

A Django-based web application using the MVC pattern to analyze and enhance password security with Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar (PCFG). It learns common password structures, assigns probabilities to patterns, and generates stronger alternatives while maintaining similarity. The system improves password security by modifying length, structure, and character groups.
